htun
====

htun is a transparent tunnel for transporting IP traffic over HTTP or TCP.

It was developed with situations in mind where traffic to the internet is
restricted. For instance, some networks don't allow traffic to the internet
at all and require you to go through an HTTP proxy. htun enables you to get
full internet access in those situations (all ports, all protocols). It also
supports using a SOCKS proxy.

Obviously, performance takes a huge hit. So it is meant for some light
browsing or downloading small files sporadically. Expect transfer rates to
be cut by a factor of up to 100.

Also, it is not encrypted by default. It is recommended to put another
tunnel on top, such as Wireguard.

Since python-pytun is required, which is a non-portable module, this will
only run on Linux.


Requirements
------------

To run htun, you need Python3 and the following modules:
* urllib3==1.24
* python_pytun==2.2.1
* pytun==1.0.1
* SocksiPy_branch==1.01

Recommended:

* hexdump==3.3


Usage
-----

The script needs to be run with root privileges both on the server and the
client. On the server, run:

    ./htun.py --server

On the client, run:

    ./htun.py --uri <SERVER URI>

By default, it uses HTTP on port 80 and the IP addresses 10.13.37.1 and
10.13.37.2 for the client and the server, respectively.

For all options, run `./htun.py --help`:

    usage: htun.py [-h] [--debug] [--client-addr CADDR] [--server-addr SADDR]

      --password PASSWORD, -W PASSWORD
                            password for HTTP proxy basic authentication (default:
                            None)

      --bind-ip BINDIP, -b BINDIP
                            bind IP address of the server component (default:
                            0.0.0.0)
      --server [SERVER]     local port and bind address (http, tcp)
                            (default: http)
      --uri URI             remote URI (<proto>://<host>[:<port>]) (default: None)


Examples
--------

### TCP Tunnel

To use a TCP tunnel on port 443, run

    ./htun.py --server tcp -p 443

on the server side and

    ./htun.py --uri tcp://<host>:443

on the client side. Now the client can reach the server via the IP address
10.13.37.2

### SOCKS Proxy

To use HTTP over a SOCKS5 proxy on port 5000, run

    ./htun.py --server

on the server side and

    ./htun.py --uri http://<host> --proxy socks5://<proxy-host>:5000

on the client side.

### Proxy Authentication

Proxies using basic authentication are supported (but yet untested).

A proxy requiring NTLM authentication is not supported because
`python-urllib3` does not support NTLM. It is suggested to use `cntlm` as an
additional SOCKS proxy.


Performance
-----------

Performance over a TCP tunnel is much better than over an HTTP tunnel.
Expect several orders of magnitude in degradation of the connection when
using HTTP.

Example downloading 713k bytes without the tunnel:

	$ curl https://example.com/example.png  > /dev/null
	  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                     Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
	100  713k  100  713k    0     0  2680k      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 2680k

Downloading the same file with an HTTP tunnel:

	$ curl https://example.com/example.png  > /dev/null
	  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                     Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
    100  713k  100  713k    0     0  12177      0  0:00:59  0:00:59 --:--:-- 16590

With a TCP tunnel it's at least around 3% of the original speed:

    $ curl https://example.com/example.png  > /dev/null
      % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time Current
                                     Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left Speed
    100  713k  100  713k    0     0  37640      0  0:00:19  0:00:19 --:--:-- 41086


To do
-----

* Make performance improvements when using HTTP
* Experiment with threaded requests


Disclaimer
----------

Keep in mind that the administrator of the network most likely did not want
you to bypass the restriction that were set up. The restriction is probably
there for a reason and you need to respect that. Using this tool may violate
terms and conditions or company rules and may possibly even get you in legal
trouble and/or fired from your job.

Use this only if you know that you have permission to use it by everyone
involved.
